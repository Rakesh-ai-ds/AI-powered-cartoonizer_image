# AI-Powered Cartoonizer

## Project Description
The AI-Powered Cartoonizer is a deep learning-based application that transforms real-world images into cartoon-style visuals. Leveraging advanced image processing techniques and neural networks, this project provides high-quality cartoon effects, making it ideal for artistic and entertainment applications.

## Features
- Converts real images into cartoon-style artwork
- Uses deep learning for enhanced image transformation
- Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.)
- Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction
- Compatible with local execution and web-based deployment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Flask (for web deployment)
- NumPy & Matplotlib (for image processing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rakesh-ai-ds/AI-powered-cartoonizer_image.git
   cd AI-powered-cartoonizer_image
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Local Execution
1. Choose an image you want to cartoonize.
2. Run the script to cartoonize an image:
   ```sh
   python cartoonizer.py --input images/original.jpg --output images/cartoonized.jpg
   ```
3. The cartoonized image will be saved in the `images/` folder.

### Web-Based Execution
1. Start the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open the provided URL in a web browser and upload an image for processing.

## Example Images
| Original Image | Cartoonized Image |
|---------------|------------------|
| ![Original](images/original.jpg) | ![Cartoonized](images/cartoonized.jpg) |

## Future Enhancements
- Optimize model performance for real-time processing
- Add more cartoonization styles
- Develop a mobile-friendly version
- Implement cloud storage and API access
