# AI-Powered Cartoonizer

## Project Description
The AI-Powered Cartoonizer is a deep learning-based application designed to transform real-world images into cartoon-style visuals. Utilizing advanced image processing techniques, this tool applies neural network models to achieve high-quality cartoon effects, making it suitable for artistic and entertainment purposes.

## Features
- Converts images into cartoon-style artwork
- Utilizes deep learning for high-quality transformations
- Supports various image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.)
- Offers an intuitive user interface for seamless image processing
- Scalable for both local and cloud-based deployment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Flask (for web-based deployment)
- NumPy & Matplotlib (for image processing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-powered-cartoonizer.git
   cd ai-powered-cartoonizer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script for local execution:
   ```sh
   python cartoonizer.py --input image.jpg --output cartoonized.jpg
   ```
2. For web-based usage:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
3. Upload an image through the web interface to receive the cartoonized version.

## Future Enhancements
- Optimize model performance for faster processing
- Integrate additional artistic styles
- Develop a mobile application version
- Implement cloud storage and API support
